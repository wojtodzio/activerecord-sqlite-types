## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This repository will contain a collection of ActiveRecord custom types that allow your Rails application to continue working seamlessly after migrating from PostgreSQL to SQLite.

The goal is to provide drop-in replacements for PostgreSQL-specific column types like `inet`, `uuid`, `array`, and more, so you can keep using your existing models and queries with minimal changes.

Stay tuned!
